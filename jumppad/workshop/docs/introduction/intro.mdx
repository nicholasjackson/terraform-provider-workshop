# Introduction

In this workshop, you will learn how to build a Terraform provider using the 
new `Terraform Plugin Framework`. You will create a plugin that allows you 
to Terraform a Minecraft world. Through writing Terraform you will be able 
to place blocks and complex objects.

## What you will learn
In this workshop you will walk through a simple example showing you everything
you need to know to build Terraform providers in Go. By the end of this workshop
you will understand:

* Composition of a Terraform provider
* Defining schema and interacting with state 
* Creating custom resources for Terraform providers
* Creating custom data-sources for Terraform providers
* Creating custom plan modifiers
* Installing and manual testing your Terraform provider
* Unit testing Terraform providers

This environment provides all the software you need to complete 
this workshop. Before continuing, let's explore this.

### API Documentation

The API for the Minecraft server is running at:

[{{ api_url }}]({{ api_url }})

You will use this when interacting with your Terraform provider through the
provided go client SDK.

Documentation for this API can be seen by viewing the `ReDoc` documentation at
the following location:

[{{ api_url }}/redoc]({{ api_url }}/redoc)


### Minecraft

There is also a Minecraft server unique to your environment; there 
is no need to worry about doing something that impacts the other participants.
You can connect to the server in one of two ways: using the built-in 
browser-based viewer or your own Minecraft client.

#### Connecting to the Server - Minecraft Client
To connect using your own Minecraft client, you can use the following settings
when adding a new server in the multiplayer options. 

```
Server: {{ minecraft_url }}
Port: 25565
```

The city you will be terraforming should look familiar to you.

**Note**
Only the Java version of Minecraft will work.

#### Connecting to the Server - Minecraft Browser

You can use the browser-based client if you do not have a Minecraft client. 
To access this, open the following URL in your browser:

[{{ prismarine_url }}]({{ prismarine_url }})

Once loaded click the play button and enter the following details to connect:

```
Server: {{ minecraft_url }}
Port: 25565
```

While this does not look as nice as the official Minecraft client, 
it is:  
a) free  
b) Minecraft in the browser

Looks aside, the browser-based client will provide all the functionality 
you need for this workshop. That is all you need to know about the setup; 
let's start building our provider.
