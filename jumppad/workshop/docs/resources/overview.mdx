# Overview

If you use the browser-based editor, open the folder `/home/src/provider`. 
If you are using your editor, you need to open the folder `./provider; for 
the rest of this guide, we will refer to all file paths as if you are using the 
browser-based editor.

The `provider` folder has been cloned from the HashiCorp scaffolding example
in the following repository.

[https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework)

There are several sub folders in this folder, these are:

| Folder       | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| docs | Autogenerated documentation |
| examples | Example Terraform configuration for the provider |
| tools | Scaffolding folder to import the documentation generation tools |
| internal/provider | Source code for the provider |

There are also some important files

| File         | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| GUNmakefile  | Makefile for the provider containing commands for building |
| terraform-registry-manifest.json | Manifest file needed by the Terraform registry |

Before continuing, let's validate that your environment is working correctly
and that you can build the example.

## Testing the Build

Open your terminal at the location where the provider source is and run the
following command to build the provider.

```shell
make build 
```

```shell
go build -o bin/terraform-provider-minecraft_v0.1.0 -buildvcs=false
```

If you look at the bin folder, you will see the following file.

```shell
➜ ls -las ./bin 
total 18792
    4 drwxr-xr-x 2 nicj nicj     4096 Nov 13 11:57 .
    4 drwxr-xr-x 9 nicj nicj     4096 Nov 13 07:13 ..
18784 -rwxr-xr-x 1 nicj nicj 19232757 Nov 13 11:57 terraform-provider-minecraft_v0.1.0
```

## Plugin Install Location

The compiled provider cannot be run directly; instead, it is intended to be 
loaded by Terraform. Terraform requires that the file has a specific naming
convention.

For Terraform to load a provider, it needs to be installed into `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins` 
again with a specific naming for the directory.

```shell
~/.terraform.d/plugins/local/[organization]/[name]/[version)/[architecture]/
```

#### Organization

The organization is your organization name; this generally aligns with the org
of your GitHub account.

#### Name

This is the provider's name; when creating a repository for a provider, 
you need to ensure that the following convention is used for the registry
to import it `terraform-provider-[name]`. Again following the same pattern 
that the binary name uses.

#### Version

The semantic version of your provider without any `v`.

#### Architecture

The architecture is actually the operating system and the architecture that the provider
has been built for. It corresponds to the GOOS and GOARCH settings. For example,
`darwin_amd64`, or `linux_arm64`.

[https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment]To simplify things, the makefile 
`GNUmakefile` contains some example configurations for building
your provider for the most common operating systems and architectures. It also 
has targets that will streamline the building and installation of the provider 
for local testing. Before we begin, why not familiarize yourself with this file? 
You will use it extensively throughout this workshop.

Let's now start to build our provider.
