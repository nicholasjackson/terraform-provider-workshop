# Acceptance Testing Resources

We have seen how you can manually test your provider but this is manual process. 
Manual testing is prone to inconsistencies and mistakes, where possible you should
always have an automated test suite.

Thankfully Terraform has a Testing framework, it enables you to write full end
to end acceptance tests against real targets.

Let's take a look at the default file from the scaffolding framework.

```go
func TestAccExampleResource(t *testing.T) {
  resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{
    PreCheck:                 func() { testAccPreCheck(t) },
    ProtoV6ProviderFactories: testAccProtoV6ProviderFactories,
    Steps: []resource.TestStep{
      // Create and Read testing
      {
        Config: testAccExampleResourceConfig("one"),
        Check: resource.ComposeAggregateTestCheckFunc(
          resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("scaffolding_example.test", "configurable_attribute", "one"),
          resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("scaffolding_example.test", "id", "example-id"),
        ),
      },
      // ImportState testing
      {
        ResourceName:      "scaffolding_example.test",
        ImportState:       true,
        ImportStateVerify: true,
        // This is not normally necessary, but is here because this
        // example code does not have an actual upstream service.
        // Once the Read method is able to refresh information from
        // the upstream service, this can be removed.
        ImportStateVerifyIgnore: []string{"configurable_attribute"},
      },
      // Update and Read testing
      {
        Config: testAccExampleResourceConfig("two"),
        Check: resource.ComposeAggregateTestCheckFunc(
          resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("scaffolding_example.test", "configurable_attribute", "two"),
        ),
      },
      // Delete testing automatically occurs in TestCase
    },
  })
}
```

You define multiple steps that allow you to test the various features such as
create, updates, reads, deletes and imports. If you are familliar with table
driven testing you may assume that the steps are the same as sub tests.

This is not the intention with Terraform tests, the steps are the operations that you
need to apply to determine an outcome. For example, if you are testing the creation
of a resource. You only need a single step to run the create with no state and 
validate the correct outcomes.  However if you wanted to test an update then you would
define two steps, the first step being the first apply that calls the create method
and the second being the second apply with existing state that would cause an update.

Delete is always automatically applied for any tests.

To provide configuration for the tests you inject this as part of the test
step.  If you look at the previous example you will see the following line. 

```
Config: testAccExampleResourceConfig("one"),
```

`testAccExampleResourceConfig` allows you to provide configuration for the test
this function is defined at the bottom of the test and simply returns a string.

```go
func testAccExampleResourceConfig(configurableAttribute string) string {
  return fmt.Sprintf(`
resource "scaffolding_example" "test" {
  configurable_attribute = %[1]q
}
`, configurableAttribute)
}
```

Let's modify example_resource_test.go and create a test for the resource.

First let's rename the file to `minecraft_schema_test.go` this is not strictly
necessary as other than the `test` suffix Go has no file name requirements. But
it is good practice.

Next let's configure the configuration for the example, for this you can use
the same resource block that was used in the manual testing.

Replace the `testAccExampleResourceConfig` function in the test file with the block
below that returns the resource from the example.

Notice that we are able to inject the x, y, and z parameters to make the configuration
reusable across multiple tests.

```go
func testAccSchemaResourceConfig(x, y, z int) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf(`
  resource "minecraft_schema" "car" {
	  x = %d
	  y = %d
	  z = %d
	  rotation = 270
	  schema = "../../../schemas/car.zip"
	}
  `, x, y, z)
}
```

Next, let's define a test step that will run an apply to test the create method.

You specify the `Config` that is going to be used for the test and then the `Check`s
are the expectations for the test. `TestCheckResourceAttr` is a basic expectation
check that tests that a particluar parameter has been set in the state of a resource.

In the following example, we are checking that the x, y, and z properties have
been correctly set.

```go
{
  Config: testAccSchemaResourceConfig(1,2,3),
  Check: resource.ComposeAggregateTestCheckFunc(
    resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("minecraft_schema.car", "x", "1"),
    resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("minecraft_schema.car", "y", "2"),
    resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("minecraft_schema.car", "z", "3"),
  ),
},
```

Replace the steps in the test file with the above code, your final example should look
like the following. 

```go
func TestAccSchemaResource(t *testing.T) {
  resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{
    PreCheck:                 func() { testAccPreCheck(t) },
    ProtoV6ProviderFactories: testAccProtoV6ProviderFactories,
    Steps: []resource.TestStep{
      {
        Config: testAccSchemaResourceConfig(-1260,24,288),
        Check: resource.ComposeAggregateTestCheckFunc(
          resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("minecraft_schema.car", "x", "-1260"),
          resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("minecraft_schema.car", "y", "24"),
          resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("minecraft_schema.car", "z", "288"),
        ),
      },
    },
  })
}

func testAccSchemaResourceConfig(x, y, z int) string {
  return fmt.Sprintf(`
resource "minecraft_schema" "car" {
    x = %d
    y = %d
    z = %d
    rotation = 270
    schema = "../../schemas/car.zip"
  }
`, x, y, z)
}
```

### Configuring the provider for testing

Finally, before we run the tests, we need to cofigure the provider to be
automatically injected. We do not want to have to build and install the provider
everytime we run a test.

If you open the file `provider_test.go` you will see the following lines

```go
var testAccProtoV6ProviderFactories = map[string]func() (tfprotov6.ProviderServer, error){
	"scaffolding": providerserver.NewProtocol6WithError(New("test")()),
}
```

Change this to the following example so that you are injecting the minecraft provider

```go
var testAccProtoV6ProviderFactories = map[string]func() (tfprotov6.ProviderServer, error){
	"minecraft": providerserver.NewProtocol6WithError(New("test")()),
}
```

## Running the tests

Finally with all this configured you can run the tests, the most important thing
to remember about runing the test is:

**Acceptance tests for Terraform will not run unless the environment variable
TF_ACC is set to a value of 1**

This is because your provider might contain both standard unit tests and acceptance tests.
Since both of these are executed by go test the environment variable gives you a way
of enabling or disabling slow tests.

Since this is an acceptance test, you also need to set the environment varialbes for
the `MINECRAFT_ENDPOINT` and the `MINECRAFT_APIKEY`. Once all this all set you can run
the following command in the terminal.

```shell
TF_ACC=1 \
MINECRAFT_ENDPOINT={{api_url}} \
MINECRAFT_APIKEY=supertopsecret \
go test -run TestAccSchemaResource github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework/internal/provider
```

If all was correct you should see the following output

```shell
ok      github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework/internal/provider 0.685s
```

That completes the basics of acceptance testing for Terraform providers and the
workshop.
